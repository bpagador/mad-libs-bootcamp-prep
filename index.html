            a poem by You <br>
            <br>
            I have eaten <br>

            the <span id="noun1-span"></span> <br>
            <br>

            you were probably <br>
            saving for <span id="noun-plural-span"></span> <br>
            <br>
            Forgive me <br>
            they were <span id="adjective1-span"></span> <br>

            a poem by William Carlos Williams <br>
            <br>
            I have eaten <br>
            the plums <br>
            that were in <br>
            the icebox <br>
            <br>

            saving<br>
            for breakfast <br>
            <br>    
            Forgive me <br>
            they were delicious <br>
            so sweet <br>
            and so cold <br>
